# Automated  Reporting 

This repository provides a structured, secure template for building Kibana/Elasticsearch saved search monitoring tools.

## Overview

The script ('final.py`) simulates a workflow that:

- Queries a Kibana saved search
- Checks whether the result count exceeds a threshold
- Exports a CSV if under the threshold
- Sends an alert if over the threshold

This structure is based on real operational use, but actual implementation logic is redacted to protect intellectual property.

## Supported Use Cases

This can be used for reporting or alerting on any log type indexed in Elasticsearch, such as:

- Firewall traffic
- Authentication logs
- Web requests
- Endpoint alerts
- Office365 events
- SIEM-enriched detections
