Cybersecurity Engineer | OSCP Certified | Security Automation and Testing

I’m a cybersecurity professional with a focus on penetration testing, security automation, and SIEM engineering. My work emphasizes structured methodologies, custom scripting, and hands-on experience across both offensive and defensive security domains.

This GitHub portfolio documents tools, scripts, and structured lab notes developed through independent research, training labs, and practical problem solving.
